## Introduction
This repo contains my attempt at the lab work of the course "EEE F341 - Analog Electronics". The modeling and simulation of the circuits was carried out in LTSPICE.

## List of experiments
1. Experiment 1 : CE Amplifier
2. Experiment 2 : Basic Configurations of Operational-Amplifier-I
3. Experiment 3 : Basic Configurations of Operational-Amplifier-II
4. EXPERIMENT 4 : Characterization of Operational Amplifier
